# PyBer Analysis of Ridesharing

## Overview 
The purpose of this project is to perform analysis of Pyber ridesharing data in order to gain an understanding of ridership and fare metrics by the types of cities in which Pyber operates, so that the decision-makers at PyBer can make informed choices regarding ways to improve the business.

## Results 
By analysis and aggregation of PyBer’s ride sharing data, below is a statistical overview and summary:

By reviewing the summary, we can see that findings indicate the following:

- Urban cities have the highest ridership demand while rural cities have the least.
- Urban cities have over four times more drivers than suburban cities.
- Suburban cities have over six times the drivers than rural areas with almost 4.5x the revenue.
- Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride and driver. 
- The summary data shows a relationship in which fare revenue is higher by city type when there is a larger ratio of drivers to rides. 

## Summary

Based on the analysis the recommendations to Pyber are following: 

The company should increase the number of drivers in rural areas to ensure there are enough drivers to meet ride demand. Data for rural cities shows that the average fare per ride and average fare per driver is much higher than suburban and urban cities. This could indicate that rural area-based riders are taking trips over a longer distance, which could result in drivers being occupied with current trips and loss in potential revenue when there are peaks in business.
